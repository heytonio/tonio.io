      Most of my work starts with a problem to solve. I've always seen design as a way to make things easier, clearer, or more useful—not just something to show. Some ideas become tools, others don't go far, but all of them help me learn.

      For more visual work, you can visit my <a href="https://dribbble.com/heytonio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dribbble</a> or <a href="https://www.behance.net/toniopadilla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behance</a>, where I share Logos, UI pieces, and smaller explorations.<br /><br />

      This space is where I keep projects and experiments I've spent time on. Some are complete, others just a step in the process, but all reflect how I approach design.

    <p class="text-[rgb(120,120,120)]">In 2014 I started <a href="https://graphichero.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphicHero</a>, a digital asset shop focused on mockups. What began as a side project turned into a store with over 11,000 sales. I handled everything—from product design and photography to support and maintenance. It gave me hands-on experience with branding, e-commerce, and creating tools that other designers actually use.</p>
